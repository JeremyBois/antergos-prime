# Antergos Prime

### This collection of scripts wants to provide GPU-switching for Hybrid-GPUs like in \*buntu-distributions for Antergos.

This is a fork of konstantingoretzki's [AntergosPrime]https://github.com/konstantingoretzki/AntergosPrime repository which in turn is a fork of emanuellopes's one [archLinuxPrime](https://github.com/emanuellopes/archLinuxPrime) which got optimized for the Antergos distribution.

We removed the prime-indicator app as it was not working anymore.

The main work of this script goes to Emanuellopes and the Linux-Mint-team, konstantingoretzki optimized some paths, updated package names, added how to fix the tearing for the Nvidia-GPU and put everything well described together, so that even people with less bash skills can (hopefully) easily follow on how to install and use AntergosPrime.

Even if this branch is made for Antergos, the installation-instructions are mostly system-independent and should therefore work with any Arch-distribution.

If you want to install this manually, go to konstantingoretzki's fork and read his readme file: [AntergosPrime]https://github.com/konstantingoretzki/AntergosPrime
